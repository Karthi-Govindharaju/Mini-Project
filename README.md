# Mini-Project

## DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
This project intends to find the area and population density
distribution of particular place and visualize then plot it as a
scatterplots.

POPULATION DISTRIBUTION:

Population distribution means the pattern of where people live.
World population distribution is uneven. Places which are sparsely
populated contain few people. Places which are densely populated
contain many people. Sparsely populated places tend to be
difficult places to live. These are usually places with hostile
environments e.g. Antarctica. Places which are densely populated
are habitable environments e.g. Europe.

POPULATION DENSITY:

Population density is a measurement of the number of people in
an area. It is an average number. Population density is
calculated by dividing the number of people by area. Population
density is usually shown as the number of people per square
kilometer. The map below is a choropleth (shading) map and
illustrates population density. The darker the color the greater
the population density.

Urbanization Patterns:

By looking at the relationship between population and area, you
can observe urbanization patterns. Some cities might have high
population densities with smaller areas, indicating more
urbanized areas, while others might have lower population
densities but larger areas, suggesting more rural or suburban
areas.

Correlation between Population and Area:

Calculating the correlation between population and area can
provide insights into whether larger cities tend to have higher
populations or if there are other factors influencing population
density, such as geographical or economic factors.

## SOURCE CODE

import pandas as pd

import numpy as np

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import seaborn as sns

cities = pd.read_csv("california_cities.csv")

latitude, longitude = cities["latd"], cities["longd"]

population, area = cities["population_total"], cities["area_total_km2"]

plt.scatter(longitude, latitude, 

c=np.log10(population), cmap='viridis', s=area, 

linewidth=0, alpha=0.5)

plt.axis(aspect='equal')

plt.xlabel('Longitude')

plt.ylabel('Longitude')

plt.colorbar(label='log$_{10}$(population)')

plt.clim(3, 7)

SOURCE CODE

for area_size in [100, 300, 500]:

plt.scatter([], [], c='k', alpha=0.3, s=area_size, label=str(area_size) + 'km$^2$')

plt.legend(scatterpoints=1, frameon=False, labelspacing=1, title='City Areas')

plt.title("Area and Population of California Cities")

plt.show()

1.Correlation Analysis: You can calculate the correlation between different 
variables to understand their relationships. For example, you can calculate 
the correlation between population and area to see if there is a correlation 
between the size of a city and its population.

correlation = cities["population_total"].corr(cities["area_total_km2"])

print("Correlation between population and area:", correlation)

SOURCE CODE

plt.hist(cities["population_total"], bins=20)

plt.xlabel("Population")

plt.ylabel("Frequency")

plt.title("Population Distribution")

plt.show()

2.Histograms and Distribution Analysis: You can plot histograms to
visualize the distribution of population, area, or any other variable. This
can help you identify patterns or understand the range and spread of the
data.

3.Summary Statistics: Calculating summary statistics like mean, median,
and standard deviation can provide insights into the central tendency and
variability of the data.

population_mean = cities["population_total"].mean()

population_median = cities["population_total"].median()

population_std = cities["population_total"].std()

print("Mean population:", population_mean)

SOURCE CODE

print("Median population:", population_median)

print("Standard deviation of population:", population_std)


4.Grouping and Aggregation: You can group the data based on certain
criteria, such as region or county, and calculate aggregate statistics for each
group. This can help in comparing different regions or identifying trends
within specific subsets of data.

grouped_data = cities.groupby("region")["population_total"].sum()

print("Population by region:")

print(grouped_data)

SOURCE CODE

5.Data Visualization: Apart from scatterplots, you can use other types of
plots like bar plots, line plots, or box plots to visualize different aspects of
the data and identify patterns or outliers.

sns.boxplot(x=cities["region"], 

y=cities["population_total"])

plt.xlabel("Region")

plt.ylabel("Population")

plt.title("Population by Region")

plt.show()

SOURCE CODE

total_population = cities["population_total"].sum()

print("Total population:", total_population)

To find total population:

The bar plot to display population in different cities
Sort the data by population in descending order

cities_sorted = cities.sort_values(by="population_total", 
ascending=False)

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

Create the bar plot
plt.bar(cities_sorted["city"], 

cities_sorted["population_total"])

SOURCE CODE

Rotate x-axis labels for better readability

plt.xticks(rotation=90)

Set the axis labels and title

plt.xlabel("City")

plt.ylabel("Population")

plt.title("Population in Different Cities in California")

Display the plot

plt.tight_layout()

plt.show()

Find total Sq Feet:

conversion_factor = 10763910.41671 # Conversion factor 

from square kilometers to square feet

cities["area_total_sqft"] = cities["area_total_km2"] * 

conversion_factor

total_sqft = cities["area_total_sqft"].sum()

print("Total square feet:", total_sqft)

## Insights

• Urbanization and City Size: 

The analysis can reveal whether larger cities tend to have
higher populations or if there are variations in population density across different cities.
It can help identify major urban centers with high population densities and smaller
towns or rural areas with lower population densities.

• Resource Allocation and Infrastructure Planning:

Understanding the population density can assist in resource allocation and infrastructure planning. Areas with higher
population densities may require more services, such as transportation, housing,
healthcare facilities, and educational institutions, to support the needs of the
population.

• Land Utilization and Efficiency: 

Analyzing the relationship between area and population
can provide insights into how efficiently land is utilized in different cities. It can help
identify areas with high population densities relative to their land area, indicating
efficient land utilization, or areas with low population densities, suggesting potential
opportunities for development or land use improvements.

• Regional Comparisons: 

Comparing population densities across different regions or
cities within California can reveal variations in urbanization levels and
development patterns. It can help identify areas that are more densely populated
and potentially experiencing more urban growth and economic activity.

• Growth and Expansion: 

Analyzing the population density trends over time can
provide insights into population growth and expansion patterns. It can help identify
areas with rapidly growing populations and potential areas for future development.
